# RSS Telegram Bot
 Inspired by my favorite RSS-to-Telegram-Bot by BoKKeR.
 

## What does it do?
 Conditionally notify users when new RSS is retrieved using telegram's bot api. \
 It's different from the original RSS-to-Telegram-Bot by BoKKeR, I made it so that it gives me updates when they contain keywords that I'm interested in.

## Why did you rewrite it?
 While the original python bot worked just fine, I was not able to run it on my router due to it being slow. \
 Since Nim code is compiled, it's much more performant, which it did in my case. \
 There's much to be done later, currently, it's for my personal use only.
